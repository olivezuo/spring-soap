## The SOAP webservice client for Spring Boot Project

Spring boot example provide a quite straightforward way to call SOAP web service. There are 2 reasons I wrap it a different way:
1. A project might need multiple SOAP client to different APIs.
2. Hide the SOAP details from the actually business logic.

## Usage
The com.jin.stock package show how we can use the SOAP Client.
